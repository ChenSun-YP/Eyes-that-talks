# Statement
不太会说话的眼睛 The Unspoken



-有的人眼睛会说话，这是一种与生俱来的天赋，但我没有。

-我所知道的，是每天撑开眼皮，眼睛里存在两个镜像且垂直翻转的图像，一个映射给视神经，一个浮在结膜上。



眼睛天生不是用来说话的器官，它无法发出任何声音，也捕捉不到声音的信号，即使在最痛的时候眼泪泄洪般不可阻拦，也是静悄悄的。会说话的眼睛有着超越语言表达的能力，它们掌握了一种不动声色传递信息的语言系统。但这都与我无关，我的眼睛不太会说话。



Some people’s eyes talk. It’s a gift I’ve never had.

Every day I open my eyes and let all images print on my retina. There are two mirrored, vertically flipped images in your eyes: one mapped to the optic nerve and another floating on the conjunctiva. 



The eye is not an organ that speaks. It cannot make any sounds, nor have the ability to capture sound signals. Even when we feel the most pain, and tears come flooding down our faces, it is quiet. Talking eyes have the ability to transcend verbal expression. They have a language system that transmits information in a silent way. But these have nothing to do with me, my eyes are not very good at talking.
